# Gradient-Descent-for-Linear-Regression
### An algorithm to find BEST FIT line 
Linear regression, a cornerstone of machine learning, empowers us to understand and predict the relationship between a dependent variable (what we want to forecast) and one or more independent variables (factors influencing the dependent variable). It assumes a linear association between these variables, making it a powerful tool for various tasks like trend analysis and value estimation. But how do we find the optimal line that best fits our data? Hereâ€™s where Gradient Descent swoops in!
